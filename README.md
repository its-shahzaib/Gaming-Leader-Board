# Gaming-Leader-Board
Project for DSA course.
🎮 Gaming Leaderboard System

A modern, dynamic Gaming Leaderboard Web Application that ranks players based on their scores in real time. This project demonstrates the practical use of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) integrated with a full-stack web application.

🚀 Features

🏆 Real-time player ranking system

➕ Add new players with custom scores

🔄 Update player scores dynamically

❌ Delete players from the leaderboard

🎲 Simulate random matches to update scores

⭐ Display Top 3 players using an efficient algorithm

💎 Modern, responsive, gaming-style UI

🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms Used

This project is designed to showcase DSA concepts in a real-world scenario:

Linked List

Used to store and manage player data dynamically

Quick Sort

Used to sort players based on scores in descending order

Heap (Priority Queue)

Used to efficiently retrieve the Top 3 players

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend

Python

Flask

Flask-CORS

Frontend

HTML5

CSS3 (Gaming / Neon UI)

JavaScript (Fetch API)
